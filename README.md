# A Game of Thrones LCG 2nd Edition Setup Analyzer

This provides some basic setup analysis for A Game of Thrones 2nd Edition.

This project was mostly done to learn Typescript/React. So as a result some things
are probably not done the best at the moment. I'm still working on improving
it overall.

In it's current state it was mostly derived from here: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/typescript-react
Including many of the base css styling still being held over from that.
